# Overview

## 📐 Project scope

* **Timeline: Needs to built within 5 working days from the request**

## 🗣️ Elevator Pitch

This is a simple game. A player is expected to collect as many fruits as possible without touching spiders.

## 💵 Monetization

I create this game only to learn how to build a web application with JavaScript and Phaser 3. Monetization is not under concern for now.

# Story

The main character lives in a small town. In this town, there is a big mountain and a big tree. She loves taking fruits that are fallen down from the biggest tree in this town.

# Gameplay

In this game, she takes apples, bananas, and pineapple that falls from the tree. Sometimes, spiders fall along with fruits. She hates spiders, so a player needs to avoid touching spiders. If a player touches a spider, the game will be over.
