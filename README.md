## About the Project

This project is to build a platform game with **Phaser** library, and was built as the JavaScript capstone project at Microverse.

In this project, I was expected to implement these things:
- Apply a scoring system using the given API to save the score associated to the game and the user name, and display a leaderboard 
- 


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
